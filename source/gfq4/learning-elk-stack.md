## 1: INTRODUCTION TO ELK STACK

- The need for log analysis
  - issue debugging
  - performance analysis
  - security analysis
  - predictive analysis
  - internet of things and logging
      "log data is expected to play a crucial role in understanding system behavior and reducing downtime."
- Challenges in log analysis
  - Non-consistent log format
      "Every application and device logs in its own special way, so each format needs its own expert. Also, it is difficult to search across because of different formats."
  - decentralized logs
      "complexity of log analysis increases with multiple components logging at multiple locations"
  - expert knowledge requirement
      "People interested in getting the required business-centric information out of logs generally don't have access to the logs or may not have the technical expertise to figure out the appropriate information in the quickest possible way"
- The ELK Stack
  - Elasticsearch
      "分布式搜索引擎基于 Apache Lucene. It provides horizontal scalability, reliability, and multitenant capability for real-time search"
      "through JSON over a RESTful API. The searching capabilities are backed by a schema-less Apache Lucene Engine, which allows it to dynamically index data without knowing the structure beforehand"
      "such as multilingual search, geolocation, autocomplete, contextual did-you-mean suggestions, and result snippets"
  - Logstash
  		
  - Kibana
- ELK data pipeline
- ELK Stack installation
